DIDs, or decentralized identifiers, provide a way to identify users or organizations in a decentralized way. DIDs can be used as account identifiers.

0:20
For example, someone using a specific service would create a DID associated with that service that they control. They could use this DID to authorize access to the service, and manage assets the service may provide and permissions it may request.

0:40
In non-decentralized environments, the account information is controlled and owned by the service provider. With decentralized identities, the identity and the data associated with it, are controlled and owned by the user. This allows the user to use the DID with many different services and in many different contexts, and control the information associated with it.

## Common gotchas

- **DIDs are NFTs:** DIDs are actually a special type of NFT. This ensures uniqueness and that only one entitiy has control of any one DID.
- **DID limits:** A user can generate many DIDs and associate each one with different services or assets.
